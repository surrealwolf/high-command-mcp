# Project Reorganization Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

Successfully reorganized the High-Command MCP Server project structure for better maintainability and clarity.

---

## What Was Moved

### 1. **Documentation Files → `docs/` folder**

All markdown documentation files have been consolidated in the `docs/` folder:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/API.md` | API endpoint reference |
| `docs/SETUP.md` | Installation guide |
| `docs/ENDPOINT_EXPANSION.md` | Endpoint expansion changelog |
| `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` | Project summary |
| `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Status report (now in docs) |
| `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` | Quick start guide |
| `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `docs/ITERATION_SUMMARY.md` | Development iteration notes |
| `docs/COMPLETION_REPORT.md` | Completion report |

### 2. **Development Instructions → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**

Development patterns, conventions, and guidelines moved to:
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Comprehensive guide for AI assistants and developers

This file contains:
- Project overview and structure
- Code patterns and conventions
- Development workflow
- API methods and tools reference
- Testing guidelines
- Common tasks and commands

### 3. **Test Demonstration Scripts → `tests/` folder**

Demo/showcase scripts moved to `tests/` folder with clearer naming:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/demo_all_endpoints.py` | Demonstrates all 7 MCP tools |
| `tests/demo_new_endpoints.py` | Demonstrates new biomes and factions endpoints |

**Note:** These are demonstration scripts, not unit tests. They're complementary to the unit tests:
- Unit tests: `test_api_client.py`, `test_models.py`, `test_server.py`
- Demo scripts: `demo_*.py`

### 4. **Updated Root Documentation Files**

Root-level files now point to organized documentation:

- **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Summary with links to detailed docs
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Updated with links to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **`README.md`** - Unchanged (primary entry point)
